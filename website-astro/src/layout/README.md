# `website-astro/src/layouts`

This folder contains _Layout components_ made in Astro. Layout components are components that define an overarching page structure that is used by multiple pages.

`BaseLayout` is the most basic Layout component; all other layouts are extensions of this layout, for more specific layouts shared across pages. `BaseLayout` defines basic metadata tags for SEO, and the high-level page structure of the header, main content, and footer.
